// Instructions
// Write a JavaScript program that recreates the pattern below.
// Do this challenge twice: first by using one loop, then by using two nested for loops 
// (Nested means one inside the other - check out “nested for loops” on Google).

let stars = " ";
for (let i=0; i<=6;i++){
    stars+= "* ";
}
    console.log(stars)
